# Vhape â€“ Simplifying API Security for Junior Developers and Startup Founders

---

## About

Vhape is a university project developed for the *Data Structures and Compilers* course at Global University. It was inspired by the common problem faced by developers and startup founders: many people cannot validate the security of their APIs because they lack the necessary knowledge and time.

Vhape provides a minimalistic framework to **validate REST API authentication and authorization** using a **simple Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** and **BDD-style scenarios (Behave)**. This allows junior developers and non-technical founders to **quickly check if their APIs are secure**, without needing deep security expertise.

---

## Key Features

- **Simple DSL:** Use plain phrases like `valid token`, `expect 401`, `access denied`.
- **BDD with Behave:** Write and execute structured scenarios.
- **Multiple Scenarios Support:** Test several authentication cases in a single file.
- **Clear Reporting:** Get understandable feedback about API security.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Parser, steps, and features are organized for future growth.
